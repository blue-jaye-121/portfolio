Participation in WISE Living & Learning Village
-----------------------------------------------

For my first three semesters at NCSU, I chose to live and participate in the 
Women in Science and Engineering Living and Learning Village. I lived and connected with with other
women who were passionate about engineering and the sciences, and have been grateful for 
this experience throughout my undergraduate career.

Meteorology Major and Computer Programming Minor
------------------------------------------------

For my undergraduate studies at NCSU, I completed a meteorology 
major in the College of Science and a computer programming minor 
in the College of Engineering. This might not have been my original 
plan upon entering college, but I am happy with the interdisciplinary 
skills, including communication, that I have learned. This endeavor 
represents a high impact experience across my entire undergraduate career.

Cumulative Honors Reflection
----------------------------
After the three years of my undergraduate career, I reflected on my 
experiences that have shaped the human being I have become in this 
cumulative honors program reflection. Each of this site’s artifacts 
are analyzed, and I comment on how each has built the path I am now 
walking. I also conclude with my thoughts about my undergraduate 
experience and my time in the honors program at NC State.
