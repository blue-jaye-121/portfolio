E 102 Honors Assignment

Engineering the Tools of Scientific Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of earning honors credit for my section of E102 (Engineering in the 21st Century),
I wrote an essay on the relationship between science and engineering. This was one of 
my first experiences reflecting on the intersection of physical science and engineering,
helping spark my excitement for these interdisciplinary connections.

Yahtzee Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For my cumulative project in my section of CSC116: Introduction to Computing - Java, 
I worked collaboratively with three of my peers to create a program allowing for the 
user to play Yahtzee. This tuned my programming skills, but also was a learning experience 
in collaborative programming. Below is a video of a playthrough of the software and the 
report on the program.
