E 102 Honors Assignment
-----------------------
Engineering the Tools of Scientific Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of earning honors credit for my section of E102 (Engineering in the 21st Century),
I wrote an essay on the relationship between science and engineering. This was one of 
my first experiences reflecting on the intersection of physical science and engineering,
helping spark my excitement for these interdisciplinary connections.

CSC 116 Comprehensive Exercise

Yahtzee Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For my cumulative project in my section of CSC116: Introduction to Computing - Java, 
I worked collaboratively with three of my peers to create a program allowing for the 
user to play Yahtzee. This tuned my programming skills, but also was a learning experience 
in collaborative programming. Below is a video of a playthrough of the software and the 
report on the program.

ENG 333 Microreview
-------------------
Measuring Urban Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Emissions Using Satellite Remote Sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In ENG 333 - Communication for Science and Research, I completed a “micro-review”: a
condensed version of a literature review. This taught me about journal formatting requirements, 
searching and reading scientific literature, and the core of scientific communication. 
This experience taught me about the inherent interdisciplinarity that science requires 
and helped me fine-tune these vital communication skills.

MEA 511 Radar Project
---------------------
Radar Configuration for Storm Monitoring in Binghamton, NY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of my graduate-level remote sensing course (MEA 511), AJ, McKenzie, and 
myself (pictured below) created a proposal of a radar setup for the town of Binghampton, 
New York. This advanced our knowledge of remote sensing, our data analysis prowess, our 
professional presentation skills, and our ability to make and justify decisions based on 
scientific evidence.
