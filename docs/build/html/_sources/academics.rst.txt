E 102 Honors Assignment
-----------------------
Engineering the Tools of Scientific Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of earning honors credit for my section of E102 (Engineering in the 21st Century),
I wrote an essay on the relationship between science and engineering. This was one of 
my first experiences reflecting on the intersection of physical science and engineering,
helping spark my excitement for these interdisciplinary connections.

CSC 116 Comprehensive Exercise
------------------------------
Yahtzee Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For my cumulative project in my section of CSC116: Introduction to Computing - Java, 
I worked collaboratively with three of my peers to create a program allowing for the 
user to play Yahtzee. This tuned my programming skills, but also was a learning experience 
in collaborative programming. Below is a video of a playthrough of the software and the 
report on the program.

ENG 333 Microreview
-------------------
Measuring Urban Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Emissions Using Satellite Remote Sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In ENG 333 - Communication for Science and Research, I completed a “micro-review”: a
condensed version of a literature review. This taught me about journal formatting requirements, 
searching and reading scientific literature, and the core of scientific communication. 
This experience taught me about the inherent interdisciplinarity that science requires 
and helped me fine-tune these vital communication skills.

MEA 511 Radar Project
---------------------
Radar Configuration for Storm Monitoring in Binghamton, NY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of my graduate-level remote sensing course (MEA 511), AJ, McKenzie, and 
myself (pictured below) created a proposal of a radar setup for the town of Binghampton, 
New York. This advanced our knowledge of remote sensing, our data analysis prowess, our 
professional presentation skills, and our ability to make and justify decisions based on 
scientific evidence.

HON 300 Race Project
--------------------
The Death of DEI: An HBCU Perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During my Spring 2024 HON 300 (Race, Membership, and Eugenics) course, 
I worked with my peers to create a video project documenting the perspective 
of HBCU students on the topic of DEI policies. This was far outside of 
anything I had done as part of a STEM course, and this project taught me 
cultural competence, challenged my preexisting biases, and made me a more 
well-rounded person. **Click the image below to see the final video.**

DSA 202 Final Project
---------------------
Exploring the Impact of Growing Location on Coffee Bean Quality Scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another interdisciplinary project during my time at NCSU was my DSA 202 
(Introduction to Data Visualization) course final project. Our team - a 
meteorologist, computer scientist, and statistician - chose to make visualizations 
and present on the quality of coffee versus their growing locations. This project 
increased my focus on accessibility in presentations and the role of simplicity 
in effectively communicating data to your audience.
