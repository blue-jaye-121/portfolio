13th Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference

Measuring Urban Carbon Dioxide Emissions By Satellite Sensing: A Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While attending the Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference in November 2024, 
I presented a poster on the microreview project completed in ENG 333. I was honored to be 
chosen to attend the conference, and I have fond memories of being nervous to present and 
then feeling the fears melt away and turn into the excitement of sharing my work with others.

NSF Unidata Internship
----------------------
Over the summer of 2025, I had the privilege of being an intern at NSF Unidata in Boulder, CO. 
This experience tuned my coding and development skills as well as introducing me to independent 
research projects. Between spending time hiking the flatirons with my peers and developing a 
continuous development/continuous integration pipeline in my work, this summer had a doubtless 
positive impact on my future path.

NSF Unidata Summer Project
--------------------------
Performative Benchmarking of Unidata MetPy with ASV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During my internship at NSF Unidata, I worked on a project 
involving the performance benchmarking of the Unidata MetPy python package. 
This taught me collaborative programming skills, DevOp concepts, and what a 
day in the life of a software engineer is like. This project solidified my love 
for programming while also teaching me that I want to focus a bit more on 
meteorology research in my career. **Click the image below to see a recording of 
my end-of-summer seminar presentation.**

106th AMS Annual Meeting Presentation
-------------------------------------
Performative Benchmarking of Unidata MetPy in a CI/CD Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a cap to my undergraduate experience, I presented a poster at the American 
Meteorological Society’s 106th annual meeting in Houston, TX. This was a great 
way to network with potential graduate school advisors and professors, as well 
as a way to share the work I had done over the summer with Unidata. It was 
bittersweet to know that this was my last time attending AMS as an undergraduate, 
and I cherished every moment.
