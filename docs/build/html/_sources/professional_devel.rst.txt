Measuring Urban Carbon Dioxide Emissions By Satellite Sensing: A Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While attending the Naval Academy Science and Engineering Conference in November 2024, 
I presented a poster on the microreview project completed in ENG 333. I was honored to be 
chosen to attend the conference, and I have fond memories of being nervous to present and 
then feeling the fears melt away and turn into the excitement of sharing my work with others.

NSF Unidata Internship
----------------------
Over the summer of 2025, I had the privilege of being an internship at NSF Unidata in Boulder, CO. 
This experience tuned my coding and development skills as well as introducing me to independent 
research projects. Between spending time hiking the flatirons with my peers and developing a 
continuous development/continuous integration pipeline in my work, this summer had a doubtless 
positive impact on my future path.
