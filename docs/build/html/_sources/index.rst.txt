About Me
--------

I am an undergraduate at North Carolina State University in my final year of study with
a major in meteorology and a minor in computer programming. I plan to enter a graduate program
in atmospheric science in order to pursue a career as a research scientist studying
numerical modeling and atmospheric dynamics.
